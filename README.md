Development Process
Data Fetching: The app retrieves transport data from the browser's localStorage. If there is saved data, it is parsed and formatted to be displayed on the page.

Loading State: A loading state is added using React's useState and useEffect hooks to handle asynchronous data fetching. While the data is being loaded, a loading message is displayed.

UI Design: The user interface is built using Tailwind CSS classes to create a responsive and visually appealing design. A simple list layout is used to display the transport details.

Pagination: A basic pagination system is implemented with buttons to navigate between pages of transport data.
